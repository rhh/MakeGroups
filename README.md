# Groups
Tool to make up spontanous workgroups based on studentlists. No. students per group can be selected.

30jan17 (rhh) Initial version. Data represented by simple String-array, display by JTable (no. rows dynamically adjusted)
23feb17 (ah)  Error hardening, student loading and absent student handling added



Todo:
o GUI beautification...
  - initial window size does not fit -> layout-manager?
  - checkboxes to large for JTable (or JTable to small)
  - display of group-name somewhere (filename -> titlebar?)
  - absent students should not be deleted but disabled (latecomers!)
  - open-file-dialog should start in data-folder
  - "groupsize" textbox -> picker, dropdownbox, o.a.
  
o MWP design?!
....
o translation to PHP o.a. ???

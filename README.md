# Groups
Tool to make up spontanous workgroups based on studentlists. No. students per group can be selected.

30jan17 (rhh) Initial version. Data represented by simple String-array, display by JTable (no. rows dynamically adjusted)



Todo:
- solid data representation for multiple studentlists (courses).
- GUI selection of studentlist
- handling of not present students (nps :-) (boolean tags in JTable???)
....
- translation to PHP o.a. ???
